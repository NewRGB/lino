========

2019-01-04 We released Lino 19.1.0

New :class:`lino.core.fields.TableRow`.

The message "Form fields may not be submitted with invalid values" says now
"Please check all fields of this form before submitting."
(:xfile:`linoweb.js`)

2019-01-07 We released Lino 19.1.2

Immediately after the release we discovered a bug in Lino 19.1.2 which caused a
missing |insert| button in a critical place in Tera.  So we did a quick bugfix
release 19.1.3.
