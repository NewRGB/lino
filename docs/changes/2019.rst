2019-01-10
==========

I fixed :ticket:`2784` (Some actions are duplicated).  The show action of
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.integ.ActivityReport` was duplicated in
:attr:`Actor._actions_list` but nobody ever complained because it was not
visible. But since I wrote a test case in :ref:`welfare.specs.integ` which
verifies that the ticket is fixed, I must now do a release on PyPI to get the
test suite on :ref:`travis` passing again.

2019-01-07
==========

We released Lino 19.1.2

Immediately after the release we discovered a bug in Lino 19.1.2 which caused a
missing |insert| button in a critical place in Tera.  So we did a quick bugfix
release 19.1.3.

2019-01-04
==========
We released Lino 19.1.0

New :class:`lino.core.fields.TableRow`.

The message "Form fields may not be submitted with invalid values" says now
"Please check all fields of this form before submitting."
(:xfile:`linoweb.js`)
