2019-01-02
==========

Field values for actons with paramiers no long need to be an array with a key of 'fv'.
They now can be included in the root of the data object with the field name as the key. 

2019-01-28
==========

We fixed the :ticket:`2782` (Dashboard in Jane is slower than before).
Store has a new attribute `_disabled_fields_storefield`.

2019-01-24
==========

Changed the verbose name for :class:`lino.modlib.printing.BuildMethods` from
"Build method" to "Print method".


2019-01-22
==========

:mod:`lino.sphinxcontrib.help_text_extractor` caused a Sphinx warning
:message:`RemovedInSphinx20Warning: app.info() is now deprecated. Use
sphinx.util.logging instead.` (fixed)

Added intersphinx_urls, srcref_url and doc_trees settings to the main module so
that other doctrees can link to the docs.

2019-01-16
==========
I fixed :ticket:`2785` (Django 2.1.5 under Py3 restore.py fails saying
disable_constraint_checking).
For the test :class:`lino.utils.djangotest.RestoreTestCase`, we need to make
sure that foreign_keys is set to OFF before we actually start the restore.

2019-01-10
==========

I fixed :ticket:`2784` (Some actions are duplicated).  The show action of
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.integ.ActivityReport` was duplicated in
:attr:`Actor._actions_list` but nobody ever complained because it was not
visible. But since I wrote a test case in :ref:`welfare.specs.integ` which
verifies that the ticket is fixed, I must now do a release on PyPI to get the
test suite on :ref:`travis` passing again.

2019-01-07
==========

We released Lino 19.1.2

Immediately after the release we discovered a bug in Lino 19.1.2 which caused a
missing |insert| button in a critical place in Tera.  So we did a quick bugfix
release 19.1.3.

2019-01-04
==========
We released Lino 19.1.0

New :class:`lino.core.fields.TableRow`.

The message "Form fields may not be submitted with invalid values" says now
"Please check all fields of this form before submitting."
(:xfile:`linoweb.js`)
